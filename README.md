# CoursesBooking

This repository contains a simple web-app to provide a course booking service for a fictitious gym.
Through the app the manager user can add or remove courses to the calendar. Gym customers can instead use the app to book the courses they wish to attend.

The application was created to practice JavaEE technologies.

[These slides](https://github.com/MaurizioPulizzi/CoursesBooking/blob/main/documentation/presentation.pdf) show an application use case and more details on the app architecture.
